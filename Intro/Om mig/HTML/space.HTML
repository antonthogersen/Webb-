            <img src="/Bilder/komet.jpg" class="space" alt="comet">
            <p>A comet is an icy small Solar System body that, when passing close to the Sun, warms and begins to release gases, a process called outgassing. This produces a visible atmosphere or coma, and sometimes also a tail. These phenomena are due to the effects of
                     solar radiation and the solar wind acting upon the nucleus of the comet.</p>

            <h2>Jupiter</h2>
            <img src="/Bilder/jupiter.jpg" class="space" alt="Jupiter">
            <p>Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a giant planet with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two-and-a-half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. Jupiter and
             Saturn are gas giants; the other two giant planets, Uranus and Neptune, are ice giants. Jupiter has been known to astronomers since antiquity.</p>

            <img src="/Bilder/shuttle.jpg" class="space" alt="space shuttle">
            <p>The Space Shuttle was a partially reusable low Earth orbital spacecraft system operated by the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), as part of the Space Shuttle program. Its official program name was Space Transportation System (STS),
                 taken from a 1969 plan for a system of reusable spacecraft of which it was the only item funded for development.[10] The first of four orbital test flights occurred in 1981, leading to operational flights beginning in 1982. </p>

            <h2>Pluto</h2>
            <img src="/Bilder/pluto.jpg" class="space" alt="pluto">
            <p>luto was discovered by Clyde Tombaugh in 1930 and was originally considered to be the ninth planet from the Sun. After 1992, its status as a planet was questioned following the discovery of several objects of similar size in the Kuiper belt. 
                In 2005, Eris, a dwarf planet in the scattered disc which is 27% more massive than Pluto, was discovered. This led the International Astronomical Union (IAU) to define the term "planet" formally in 2006, during their 26th General Assembly. 
                That definition excluded Pluto and reclassified it as a dwarf planet.</p>

            <h2>Big Bang</h2>
            <img src="/Bilder/bigbang.jpg" class="space" alt="bigbang">
            <p>Since Georges Lemaître first noted in 1927 that an expanding universe could be traced back in time to an originating single point, scientists have built on his idea of cosmic expansion. The scientific community was once divided between supporters
                 of two different theories, the Big Bang and the Steady State theory, but a wide range of empirical evidence has strongly favored the Big Bang which is now universally accepted.</p>

            <h2>Niel Armstrong</h2>
            <img src="/Bilder/niel.png" class="space" alt="niel armstrong">
            <p>Neil Alden Armstrong (August 5, 1930 – August 25, 2012) was an American astronaut and aeronautical engineer who was the first person to walk on the Moon. He was also a naval aviator, test pilot, and university professor.</p>

            <img src="/Bilder/bluesun.jpg" class="space" alt="blue gaint">
            <p>In astronomy, a blue giant is a hot star with a luminosity class of III (giant) or II (bright giant). In the standard Hertzsprung–Russell diagram, these stars lie above and to the right of the main sequence.</p>
